+++ Need to add case_when for all those with mistakes in their entries, to identify them for recontacting


Configure global options for all chunks
```{r Setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  comment = '',
  prompt = FALSE,
  cache = FALSE
  )
```

Clear global environment prior to initiation
```{r Clear global environment}
remove(list = ls())
```

Add the add_numeric function - used to convert character variables into numeric variables.
Add the sumscores function - used to generate sumscores
Add the package_check function - used to install and load dependencies
```{r Read in functions}
source(file = "scripts/functions/add_numeric.R")
source(file = "scripts/functions/remove_duplicates.R")
source(file = "scripts/functions/sumscores.R")
source(file = "scripts/functions/package_check.R")
source(file = "scripts/functions/imp_check.R")

#BMI specific
source(file = "scripts/functions/capture_repeated_text_entry.R")
```

Use package_check to install and load dependencies
Load tidyverse last
```{r Install load dependencies}
packages <- c("summarytools", "sjlabelled", "Amelia", "gtsummary", "tidyverse")
package_check(packages)
```

Retrieve recent date
We are using the recent date to save files with paste0() as an extension to not overwrite old versions
```{r Recent date}
date <- Sys.Date()
date
```

Read in file with path to ilovedata channel on Teams
Ensure that your credentials directory is correctly located
```{r Read in file with path to ilovedata channel on teams}
source(file = "../credentials/paths.R")
```

Add negating function
```{r Add negating function}
`%nin%` = Negate(`%in%`)
```

# Read in the data: Demographics

## GLAD data
```{r GLAD read in data}
glad_dat <- readRDS(file = paste0(ilovedata, "/data_raw/2022-09-16/glad/dem_glad.rds"))
  
#Check
glad_dat %>%
  colnames()

glad_dat %>%
  dim()
```

Specify columns to be excluded from add_numeric function
Continuous variables should be excluded, as they are already numeric
```{r GLAD specify excluded columns}
exclude_cols_numeric <- c(
  "ID",
  "sample",
  "startDate",
  "endDate"
  )
```


Select & rename relevant columns (will be a function at some point)

# GLAD: Height

## GLAD: Height in ft (feet)
1 foot are 30.48 cm
Conversion: multiply the length value (in foot) by 30.48
On average, values between 4 and 7 feet (ft) are expected.
```{r GLAD height_signup_ft_unc inspection}
glad_dat_id %>%
  freq(height_signup_ft_unc)
```

Conversion to numeric
If they have a 0 at the beginning (e.g., 0180), they automatically get converted to numeric (without the 0 at the beginning) using the function as.numeric.
NB: We need to convert to numeric before we can perform calculations on the column.
```{r GLAD height_signup_ft_unc Conversion to numeric and positive value}
glad_dat_id <- glad_dat_id %>%
  mutate(
    height_signup_ft_unc_numeric =

Need to identify people that have entered their height in inches and height in feet twice.

```

Everyone with a value of 12 or above should be coded as implausible, i.e., -666 (12 inches = 1 foot; if someone were to put 5ft12, they are actually 6ft).
NB: Implausible values are coded as -666.
One would expect values between 0 and 11 inches.
```{r merged data height_signup_inches_unc above 12 - implausible value}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(
    height_signup_inches =
      if_else(
        condition = height_signup_inches_tidied7 >= 12 & !is.na(height_signup_inches_tidied7), 
        true = -666,

In the data freeze 2021-10-03, we have 80 implausible values (i.e., -666) in GLAD and EDGI

## GLAD & EDGI: Height in cm cleaning

Look at variable first to identify errors
One would expect values between 130 to 250 cm (i.e., 1.30-2.50 m)


If they have a 0 at the beginning (e.g., 0180), they automatically get converted to numeric (without the 0 at the beginning) using the function as.numeric.
NB: We need to convert to numeric before we can perform calculations on the column.
```{r merged data height_signup_cm_unc conversion to numeric inspection}
dat %>%
  freq(height_signup_cm_unc_numeric)
```

There are now only numeric entries in the cm variables, so can convert to numeric.

If someone has entered a value below 3, it is likely they have entered their height in metres rather than cm. Need to identify these people and convert their answers from m to cm.

If someone has entered a value with two ones at the beginning and a decimal point after the second digit, it is likely they have firstly put the decimal point in the wrong place and also accidentally entered one twice. Need to identify these people and convert their answers.

Participants with height in cm under 120 have BMIs above 55, so have entered an implausible height and/or weight. They should be investigated or be recontacted

             digits = 2)
  )
```

None of the high weights in stone has a plausible BMI: all BMIs are above 200.

If someone has entered over 90 in the stone column and also entered their weight in lbs, then they are implausible values.
NB: -666 = implausible value.
This takes care of the rest of the participants with weights above 90. 
```{r merged data weight_signup_st_unc two entries - implausible value}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(
    weight_signup_st_tidied2 =
      if_else(
        condition =
          (weight_signup_st_tidied1 > 90 & !is.na(weight_signup_st_tidied1)) & # Weight in stone above 90
          (weight_signup_lbs_unc_numeric > 0 & !is.na(weight_signup_lbs_unc_numeric)), # Weight in pounds above 0
        true = -666, 
        false = weight_signup_st_tidied1,
        missing = NA_real_
      )
  )

#Check

If someone has entered over 90 but not entered anything in the pounds (lbs) column, it is likely they have actually given their entire weight in lbs (pounds).
```{r merged data weight_signup_st_unc above 90 whole weight in pounds (lbs) check occurence}
dat %>%
  select(
    weight_signup_lbs_unc_numeric,
    weight_signup_st_tidied2
  ) %>%

    (weight_signup_st_tidied2 > 90 & !is.na(weight_signup_st_tidied2)) &
      (is.na(weight_signup_lbs_unc_numeric) |
         weight_signup_lbs_unc_numeric == 0)
  )
```


There is no one who has entered only a value in the pounds (lbs) column. Therefore it's unlikely that someone has entered their whole weight in kg or pounds (lbs) in this column. If someone were in this column, you would need to cross-check their entry with their height to work out whether it's more likely that they have entered their entire weight in lbs or in kg.

```{r merged data weight_signup_st_unc above 90 whole weight in pounds (lbs)}

All of the above have plausible values in the BMI column when assuming they have entered their entire weight in lbs in the lbs column (rather than in kg).

Convert implausible kg above 350 (there is a plausible entry of 300 kg) 

Background information:
Jon Brower Minnoch (September 29, 1941 – September 10, 1983) was an American man who, at his peak weight, was the heaviest human being ever recorded, weighing 1,400 lb (635 kilograms; 100 stone) (0.635 tons).
At the age of 12, Minnoch weighed 294 lb (133 kilograms; 21.0 stone) with an estimated height of 5 ft 7 in (170 cm),[2] and by age 22 he was 6 ft 1 in (185 cm) in height and weighed 500 lb (230 kilograms; 36 stone).[3]
BMI = 400/1.82^2 = 120.76

We assume that participants with weights above 350 kg have put the floating point in the wrong position. Therefore, we are dividing their weight by 10 to move the floating point by one decimal.

Background information:
  Jon Brower Minnoch (September 29, 1941 – September 10, 1983) was an American man who, at his peak weight, was the heaviest human being ever recorded, weighing 1,400 lb (635 kilograms; 100 stone) (0.635 tons).
At the age of 12, Minnoch weighed 294 lb (133 kilograms; 21.0 stone) with an estimated height of 5 ft 7 in (170 cm),[2] and by age 22 he was 6 ft 1 in (185 cm) in height and weighed 500 lb (230 kilograms; 36 stone).[3]
BMI = 400/1.82^2 = 120.76

Minimum and maximum cleaning chunk for BMI
We have sorted the tibble by BMI and are displaying the top 10 BMIs and the lowest 10 BMIs
Based on the the two chunks before we have chosen these cutoffs: 7 and 91

```{r merged data bmi_signup_derived_unc derive BMI define limits}
bmi_lower_limit = 7 # 
bmi_upper_limit = 91
```

```{r merged data bmi_signup_derived_unc derive BMI identify number of outliers}
dat %>%
  filter(
    bmi_signup_derived_unc > bmi_upper_limit |
      bmi_signup_derived_unc < bmi_lower_limit
  ) %>%
  nrow()
```
2021-10-03: 395 people have implausible BMIs, will be set to -666 (i.e., implausible value)
